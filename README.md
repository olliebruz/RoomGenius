# RoomGenius

RoomGenius is a cutting-edge room improvement and design app designed to help you enhance your living space effortlessly. By leveraging advanced AI, RoomGenius provides personalized recommendations to improve your room's organization and design, making your space both functional and visually appealing.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Recommendations**  
  Take a photo of your room, and RoomGenius will analyze the image to suggest improvements such as:
  - Rearranging or moving furniture to improve space efficiency and lighting (e.g., "Move your bed against the right wall to free up floor space and allow more natural light in").
  - Decluttering by identifying items to organize or store away (e.g., "Remove the PC from your desk and place it on the floor to create a cleaner workspace").
  - Enhancing the room's aesthetics by recommending new decor items like paintings, rugs, or lamps with purchase links.
  - Suggesting color schemes or lighting adjustments to create a more harmonious or vibrant atmosphere.
  - Identifying areas for adding practical items like shelves or organizers to reduce clutter.

- **Furniture Recommendations**  
  Discover furniture options tailored to your space with direct shopping links.

## Future Plans
